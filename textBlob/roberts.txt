The public's view of the court has long been among Roberts' central concerns as the nation's top judiciary officer.

In 2018, after a federal judge issued a ruling that drew the ire of then-President Donald Trump, Trump responded on Twitter, saying "that's not law" and "this was an Obama judge."

Roberts responded to the president in a statement, writing that the United States does not have "Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for."

Time will tell whether and how many Americans continue to agree with Roberts' characterization of the courts. This term, the Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority — of which Roberts is a member — has taken up a number of divisive, highly partisan issues including abortion access, gun rights and religious freedom cases.

How the Supreme Court chooses to rule in the highly watched cases, and how broadly those rulings apply, is likely to have a sizable impact on the court's reputation in the coming year.
